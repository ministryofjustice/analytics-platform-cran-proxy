# Analytics Platform Cran Proxy - DEPRECATED

## Warning

This tool is a failed experiment and we moved to using conda to manage R
projects instead.

### Decommissioning

While this is deprecated, it is still deployed in the cluster and some RStudio
instances do point their default cran server to: https://cran-proxy.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz

Until we have no more Rstudio instances using the cran proxy, it should not be
removed from the cluster.

You can check traffic going to the cran proxy with the following command:
`kubectl logs -n default -lapp=cran-proxy --since=24h`

You can check that there are `rstudio-3.4.2-6` images running in the cluster.

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{..image}" |tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' |sort |uniq -c | grep rstudio
```
The output will be something like:
```
    124 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio:1.2.1335-r3.5.1-python3.7.1-conda-3
     10 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio:3.4.2-5
      6 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio:3.4.2-6
     34 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio-auth-proxy:v2.0.0
      4 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio:r3.5.1-py3.7-conda
     64 quay.io/mojanalytics/rstudio:r3.5.1-py3.7-conda-1

```
If there are no `rstudio:3.4.2-6` images running and there's been no traffic to the endpoint
in the last few days then it should be safe to delete the cran-proxy helm deployment.

# Description

A cran mirror that compiles binary packages for the rocker:verse environment.

## Why

CRAN servers usually provide binary versions of libraries for Windows and OSX
but not for Linux. This is understandable because there's no such thing as
*"Linux OS"*. Each distribution will have a set of C libraries, version of
`libc` or a different implementation of `libc` altogether (`musl`). If you
wanted to support linux you'd have to compile hundreds of versions of each
R package to cope with a myriad of linux options. Even if you did this,
there would be a discovery problem because there is no good way for your
flavor of linux to find an R package compiled for it.

However, in our environment we've standardised on using the `rocker:verse`
docker images images with a pinned version of R (3.4). Given we know the
constraints it is possible to run a CRAN server that provides pre-compiled
R package binaries for `rocker:verse`. ðŸ†’

This is where the R ecosystem gets in the way. When you do
`install.packages('pkg', type = 'binary')` R is able to convert that to
`win.binary` or `osx.binary` depending on your operating system and R version
then look in the right place on the CRAN server for the right package. This
doesn't happen on Linux. Instead of trying to hack the R `install.packages`
function this proxy does something **non-standard**. It will, if it has a
compiled copy of a source package, send that version **instead** of the source
package requested.

R's `install.packages()` and `Packrat` both handle this and don't rebuild the
binary even if they were expecting a source package. This is crucial in making
this work.

## Gotchas

-   If you were to use this cran-proxy in a Windows or Mac environment you might
    get sent Linux binary packages. I don't know what R will do when this
    happens
-   The proxy is unaware of R version. It will send you binaries for the R
    version it is running. This means we'll need 1 instance of the cran-proxy
    for every version of R we want to support. R packages are generally
    compatible across patch version so cran-proxy running R 3.4.3 will be fine
    for clients using R 3.4.2
-   If your Linux environment is subtly different from what the cran-proxy is
    running on, your packages might install successfully but crash at run-time

# Background

This was created to solve a [real
issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform/issues/3) for our
users who experience slow Packrat installs. Our users run the web based version
of R-Studio so their OS is Linux, but official CRANs don't provide Linux
binaries.

# Security

The proxy doesn't have any endpoints that allow you to upload anything. It will
only proxy GET requests upstream so from a web perspective it's relatively hard
to exploit. 

The main area of concern is that the compilation happens inside the
same container that is running the cran-proxy. 
Ideally this would happen in a
fresh container where we copy the compiled binary out of.

# Usage

## End users

### install.packages

If you just want to try it then you can do:

```R
install.packages('package', repos='https://cran-proxy.yourserver.com')
```

If you want to persist this then add

```R
options(repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cran-proxy.services.dev.mojanalytics.xyz'), download.file.method = 'libcurl')
```

to your `.Rprofile` file.

### Packrat

Update your `packrat.lock` file to point at the proxy from:

```R
PackratFormat: 1.4
PackratVersion: 0.4.8.1
RVersion: 3.4.0
Repos: CRAN=https://cloud.r-project.org/
```

to:

```R
PackratFormat: 1.4
PackratVersion: 0.4.8.1
RVersion: 3.4.0
Repos: CRAN=https://cran-proxy.yourdomain.com
```

### Environment Variables

| Name | Default | Description |
|------------------------- |------------------------------ |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEBUG` | `FALSE` | If set to true the webserver will auto reload on changes, dump exceptions and set the log level to DEBUG |
| `PASSIVE` | `FALSE` | If set to TRUE, the server will not attempt to compile any packages and will always return source packages |
| `PORT` | `8000` | TCP Port to listen for HTTP requests on |
| `UPSTREAM_CRAN_SERVER_URL` | `https://cloud.r-project.org/` | URL of CRAN server we are proxying. <span class="underline">Include trailing slash</span> |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Can be one of `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG` |
| `BINARY_OUTPUT_PATH` | `/tmp/bin/` | Place to store built binaries. If it doesn't exist it'll be created on server start. |

### Deployment

This proxy can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm using the
corresponding
[chart](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-helm-charts/tree/master/charts/cran-proxy).

# API

-   If the request is to `/src/contrib/PACKAGES` in which case it proxies it
-   else if it is a request directly to a package's `.tar.gz` in which case it
    checks the local cache of built packages and serves the binary if it exists or
    sends a 302 to the upstream and adds it to a compile queue so future requests
    will get a precompiled binary.
-   else the proxy returns a HTTP 302 to the same path on the upstream server 

## Additional Endpoints

### `/metrics`

Prometheus metrics endpoint

### `/healthz`

Always returns a HTTP 200 OK (with no-cache headers)
